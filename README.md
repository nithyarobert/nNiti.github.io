ok
the other hand I am compiling these java applications within IntellijIdea. The problem is, I don't want to share *.iml files etc. in my public repository because I want to keep the repository as simple as possible.

In the other hand I want to store *.iml files etc. in Github for my own need. What can I achieve this requirement with Git?
